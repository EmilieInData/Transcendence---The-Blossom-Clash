Emilie:
As a product owner, my principal objective was to define a precise vision of the project, especially focusing on the design part. As the front-designer developer of the project, it was quite natural for me to commit myself to the PO role.

With my professional experience, I had already developed a palette of organisational skills useful for the position:
→ define project vision and objectives
→ prioritize tasks between team members
→ manage the backlog
→ express users’ & clients’ needs (here the 42 subject)
→ validate the website and all its options to make sure that it adds maximum value to the project
→ ensure a good customer experience

To help me in that task, I began the project with different models I created in Figma. We chose, with all team members, our favorite visual, and I created all the different related pages based on this model.

During the whole project development, we met every week to ensure good progress and consistency between our different parts. Since the beginning, we worked on the same website, with different GitHub branches of course, to avoid any final connection troubles.

I was especially involved in the design part. As an ex-fashion designer, it was amazing and really important for me to propose a project with a true design vision. All the team enjoyed working on this Vintage Japanese Botanical theme and enriched the project with their ideas!

## 11. The game (EXTRA)
### **How to Play**
Each player controls a brush-like character in a shared falling zone with three lanes:

Left   |   Middle   |   Right

Your goal is to catch falling blossoms while denying them to your opponent.

##### **Basic Controls**

* Move left/right to switch lanes
* Push to shove the opponent sideways
* Activate Perfect Meter abilities when available

You cannot pass through the opponent — lane blocking and physical contact are core to the gameplay.

### **Game Rules**

#### ***Match Format***

* Total match time: 1 minute
* Divided into two 30-second rounds (you either win 2-0 or tie 1-1, might change that)
* No buffs or disadvantages between rounds
* Highest total score after both rounds wins

##### Blossoms
Blossoms fall continuously across the 3 lanes.

:cherry_blossom: Normal Blossom

* Worth 1 point

:cherry_blossom: Middle Lane Blossom
* Worth 2 points
* Middle lane is the high-value battlefield

:blossom: Golden Blossom

* Very rare (only 4 per game)
* Worth 3 points
* Perfect catch bonus: +2 to +3 Perfect Meter points

Golden Blossoms create intense scramble moments.

##### Catching \& Perfects
###### Normal Catch
You touch the blossom anywhere in your character’s catch zone → you get its points.

###### Perfect Catch
You catch the blossom at its exact center timing point → You gain +1 point in the Perfect Meter.\
Perfect catches are vital for activating abilities.

##### Lanes \& Lane Control
There are 3 lanes you can move between:

Left  |  Middle  |  Right

###### Claiming a Lane
Catch 5 blossoms in a row in the same lane to claim it.

When you own a lane:
* Bonus perfects
  
  Perfect catches in that lane grant +1 extra Perfect Meter point\
  (normal perfect = +1, in your lane = +2)

* Contact advantage

  If both players push at the same time in your owned lane, you win the push and the opponent gets knocked back.\
  Lane control creates territorial strategy without overpowering the game.


##### Perfect Meter
The Perfect Meter fills when you catch blossoms perfectly:

* Normal perfect: +1
* Perfect in a lane you own: +2
* Golden perfect: +2 to +3

You can activate special abilities depending on how full your meter is. \
The meter empties to 0 after using an ability.

###### Perfect Meter Abilities

**At 5 Perfects → Reverse Push OR Reverse input**

Your opponent’s push turns into a pull for ~1 second OR inputs are reversed, left becomes right and right becomes left.\
Great for lane steals, repositioning and confusing the opponent.

**At 10 Perfects → Ink Freeze**
Opponent is unable to move or push for ~0.4 seconds (maybe more).\
Use it to secure key blossoms or shove them out.

**At 15 Perfects → Momentum Surge**

Your pushing force is doubled for ~1–2 seconds. This lets you dominate contested lanes, especially the middle.

##### Contact Mechanics

###### Pushing
You may push the opponent sideways to:

* Block them from lanes
* Knock them off a blossom path
* Contest Middle or Golden blossoms

###### Simultaneous Push Logic
If both players push at the same time:

* If one owns the lane → they win the push
* If neither owns the lane → no one is pushed
* Middle lane is neutral (unless a player owns it)

This preserves fairness while rewarding lane control.

##### Dynamic Field Event (Might delete)
Only one environmental event exists:

###### Wind Gust
1–2 times per round, blossoms briefly drift one lane left or right.\
This affects both players equally and forces quick lane decisions.

##### Scoring Summary
Blossom Type					| Points

------------------------------------------------|-----------

Normal Blossom					|   1

Middle Lane Blossom				|   2

Golden Blossom					|   3

Perfect Catch Bonus				| +1 PM

Lane Perfect Bonus				| +1 PM

Golden Perfect Bonus				| +2–3 PM

PM = Perfect Meter

##### Winning
After two rounds of 30 seconds, total scores are compared.\
The player with the highest score wins Blossom Clash.

### Marta's notes
- en la api gateway, no puedo dar direcciones a una misma ruta, prq sino me da un error. se ve asi en los docker logs: 

	/app/node_modules/find-my-way/index.js:291
      throw new Error(`Method '${method}' already declared for route '${pattern}' with constraints '${JSON.stringify(constraints)}'`)
            ^

- cuando en la configuracion de la api-gateway, en el index.js ponemos:

      app.listen({ port: 3000, host: "0.0.0.0" });
    Estamos binding el puerto 3000 para que todos los contenedores de la red de docker puedan acceder a ese puerto. 
    Si pusieramos en host: localhost o 127.0.0.1, solo escuchariamos requests al puerto 3000 que vieneran del mismo contenedor de api-gateway. 
    Nginx-front es un contenedor remoto, pertenece a la docker network su IP no pertenece al contenedor de la api-gateway.
    Si quisieramos decir que solo a nginx-front en especifico le escuchamos en el puerto 3000, podriamos poner firewall rules: iptables rules inside container, o verificar headers como 'X-Forwarded-For' o TLS mutua. Chatgpt no lo recomienda. Dice que en mundo real:
    - services bind to 0.0.0.0
    - access is restricted by:
            > VPCs
            > security groups
            > firewalls
            > reverse proxies
